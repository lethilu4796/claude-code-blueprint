# Starter Presets

Not sure where to start? Pick the preset that matches your situation. Each lists exactly which files to copy and the minimal settings.json to wire them up.

See [README.md](README.md#who-is-this-for) for which preset matches your profile.

---

## Minimal

**For:** Solo dev, small project, just want basic protection.
**Setup time:** 5 minutes.
**Impact:** Config protection + edit verification reminders.

### Files to copy

| Source | Destination | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Your project root | Behavioral rules (biggest single impact) |
| [`hooks/protect-config.sh`](hooks/protect-config.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Block accidental config weakening |
| [`hooks/notify-file-changed.sh`](hooks/notify-file-changed.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Remind to verify after source edits |

### Settings

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"C:/Users/YourUser/.claude/hooks/protect-config.sh\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"C:/Users/YourUser/.claude/hooks/notify-file-changed.sh\"",
            "async": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `YourUser` with your actual username. On macOS/Linux, use `/home/youruser/.claude/hooks/`.

### What you get

- Claude asks before editing ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, or build configs
- Automatic "did you verify?" reminder after every source file edit
- CLAUDE.md rules guide Claude's behavior (~80% compliance)

### What you don't get (and don't need yet)

- Git push protection (add when working with remotes)
- Agents and skills (add when your workflow demands more structure)
- Cost tracking (add when you want spending visibility)

---

## Standard

**For:** Developer comfortable with Claude Code, wants full lifecycle hooks + basic agents.
**Setup time:** 15 minutes.
**Impact:** Complete hook coverage + plan verification + code review.

### Files to copy (everything in Minimal, plus)

| Source | Destination | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| [`hooks/block-git-push.sh`](hooks/block-git-push.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Protect specific remotes from accidental pushes |
| [`hooks/cost-tracker.sh`](hooks/cost-tracker.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Track token spending to JSONL |
| [`hooks/session-checkpoint.sh`](hooks/session-checkpoint.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Crash recovery timestamps |
| [`hooks/post-commit-review.sh`](hooks/post-commit-review.sh) | `~/.claude/hooks/` | Post-commit review reminders |
| [`agents/verify-plan.md`](agents/verify-plan.md) | `~/.claude/agents/` | 7-point mechanical plan verification |
| [`agents/code-reviewer.md`](agents/code-reviewer.md) | `~/.claude/agents/` | Independent code review agent |
| [`examples/settings-template.json`](examples/settings-template.json) | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Full settings (customize paths + permissions) |

### Settings

Use the full [`settings-template.json`](examples/settings-template.json) as your base. Customize:

1. Replace all `YourUser` paths with your actual username
2. Adjust the `allow` list for your stack (remove tools you don't use)
3. Edit `block-git-push.sh` to match your protected remote URLs
4. Review hook paths -- ensure they match your OS (forward slashes on all platforms)

### What you get (beyond Minimal)

- Git push protection for specific remotes
- Token spending tracked to `~/.claude/metrics/costs.jsonl`
- Session checkpoints for crash recovery
- Post-commit review reminders with high-risk file detection
- Plan verification before implementation (catches count errors, missing wiring, stale paths)
- Independent code review from a fresh context window

---

## Full

**For:** Team or power user wanting the complete production setup.
**Setup time:** 30 minutes.
**Impact:** Full specialist ecosystem with memory persistence.

### Files to copy (everything in Standard, plus)

| Category | Source | Destination |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **All agents** | [`agents/*.md`](agents/) | `~/.claude/agents/` |
| **All hooks** | [`hooks/*.sh`](hooks/) | `~/.claude/hooks/` |
| **Skills you need** | [`skills/*/SKILL.md`](skills/) | `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| **Rules** | [`rules/*.md`](rules/) | `~/.claude/rules/` |
| **Memory template** | [`memory-template/`](memory-template/) | Your memory repo |

### What you get (beyond Standard)

- 12 specialized agents (architecture, backend, frontend, DB, DevOps, security, QA, docs)
- 20 natural-language skills (review, deploy-check, test-check, sprint-plan, etc.)
- Path-scoped rules (database conventions load only when editing schema files)
- Cross-session memory persistence via git-backed memory system
- Full lifecycle automation from session start to session end

### Customization

1. **Remove agents you don't need.** A Python project doesn't need `frontend-specialist.md`.
2. **Pick skills that match your workflow.** Start with `review`, `test-check`, and `deploy-check`. Add others as needed.
3. **Customize rules for your stack.** Edit `database-schema.md` for your ORM patterns, `api-endpoints.md` for your framework conventions.
4. **Set up your memory repo.** Follow [memory-template/README.md](memory-template/README.md) to initialize your cross-session persistence.

---

## CI/CD

**For:** Automated pipelines with no interactive use.
**Setup time:** 5 minutes.
**Impact:** Automated guardrails for CI-driven Claude Code sessions.

### Files to copy

| Source | Destination | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Project root | Rules for the CI agent |
| [`hooks/block-git-push.sh`](hooks/block-git-push.sh) | CI environment | Prevent pushes to protected branches |

### Settings

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "dontAsk"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"hooks/block-git-push.sh\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Why `dontAsk` and not `auto` for CI/CD

- `dontAsk` is deterministic -- same inputs always produce same permission decisions
- No classifier overhead (no extra token cost per action)
- No risk of classifier blocking a legitimate CI action mid-pipeline
- CI pipelines should be predictable; `auto` mode's contextual evaluation adds variability

### What you don't need in CI

- Cost tracker (use Anthropic's billing dashboard instead)
- Session memory (CI sessions are stateless)
- Interactive agents (no human to review plans)
- Notification hooks (CI has its own notification systems)

## Upgrading Between Presets

Moving from one preset to the next is additive -- you never need to redo earlier steps.

```
Minimal → Standard:  Add 4 hooks + 2 agents + full settings.json
Standard → Full:     Add remaining agents, skills, rules, memory
Any → CI/CD:         Separate concern -- CI uses its own settings, not your dev settings
```

The recommended path: start Minimal, use it for a week, then upgrade to Standard when you notice gaps. Move to Full only when you're actively using agents and skills in your workflow.
