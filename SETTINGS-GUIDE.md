# Settings Guide

Companion to [settings-template.json](examples/settings-template.json). Every setting explained with context, defaults, and rationale.

---

## Environment Variables

These live under the `"env"` key in `settings.json` and control Claude Code's runtime behavior.

### CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS

```json
"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
```

**What it does:** Enables multi-agent spawning -- the ability for Claude to launch specialized subagents that run in parallel with independent context windows.

**Why it matters:** Without this, the entire [agents/](agents/) directory in this blueprint is non-functional. The Agent tool won't appear, `subagent_type` has no effect, and skills that orchestrate multiple agents (like the review skill spawning code-reviewer + security-reviewer + db-analyst in parallel) silently degrade to single-agent mode.

**Default:** Not set (disabled). You must explicitly enable it.

**Who needs it:** Anyone using agents from this blueprint. If you're only using CLAUDE.md + hooks, you can skip this.

### CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE

```json
"CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "80"
```

**What it does:** Triggers context compaction when the context window is 80% full, instead of Claude's default threshold (higher).

**Why 80%:** Compaction is aggressive -- it summarizes and discards earlier context. By triggering it earlier, you give the PreCompact hook more room to serialize working state (active plan, modified files, current branch) to disk before context is lost. See [WHY.md](WHY.md#postcompact-hook-why-state-serialization) for the battle story.

**Default:** Claude's built-in threshold (not publicly documented, but higher than 80%).

**Trade-off:** Lower = more frequent compaction (loses context sooner) but safer state preservation. Higher = more context retained but hooks may not fire in time.

### CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS

```json
"CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS": "5000"
```

**What it does:** Gives SessionEnd hooks 5 seconds to complete before the Claude Code process exits.

**Why 5 seconds:** The default timeout is lower. Hooks like `session-checkpoint.sh` write state to disk and may need a moment to complete. Without enough time, the hook gets killed mid-write, leaving incomplete or corrupt checkpoint files.

**Default:** Lower than 5000ms (varies by version).

### CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB

```json
"CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB": "1"
```

**What it does:** Strips sensitive environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, AWS credentials, cloud tokens) from subprocess environments -- hooks, MCP servers, and Bash commands.

**Why it matters:** Without this, any subprocess Claude spawns inherits your full environment, including API keys. A malicious or buggy MCP server could read your Anthropic API key from its own environment.

**Default:** Not set (subprocesses inherit all env vars).

**Who needs it:** Everyone running MCP servers or custom hooks. Minimal risk to enable -- your hooks and MCP servers almost never need your Anthropic API key.

---

## Top-Level Settings

### cleanupPeriodDays

```json
"cleanupPeriodDays": 60
```

Auto-deletes Claude Code session data older than 60 days. This includes conversation logs and temporary files -- not your project code, hooks, or agents.

**Default:** Check Claude Code docs for the current default. 60 days is a reasonable balance between disk usage and being able to reference old sessions.

### includeGitInstructions

```json
"includeGitInstructions": false
```

**What it does:** When `true`, Claude Code injects default git usage instructions into every session's context. When `false`, those instructions are suppressed.

**Why false:** This blueprint provides its own git rules via [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (Diagnose-First Rule checks `git status` first) and hooks (`block-git-push.sh` prevents accidental pushes). The default instructions conflict with these custom rules and waste context tokens.

**When to set true:** If you're not using custom git rules and want Claude's default git behavior.

### alwaysThinkingEnabled

```json
"alwaysThinkingEnabled": true
```

**What it does:** Claude uses extended thinking (chain-of-thought reasoning) on every response, not just when the task seems complex.

**Trade-off:** Better reasoning quality, especially for subtle bugs and architectural decisions. Costs more tokens per response (thinking tokens are billed). For simple tasks like "rename this variable," extended thinking is overkill -- but the quality improvement on complex tasks outweighs the cost.

### effortLevel

```json
"effortLevel": "high"
```

**What it does:** Sets Claude's reasoning effort to maximum. Pairs with `alwaysThinkingEnabled` for deepest analysis.

**Options:** `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`. Lower effort = faster, cheaper responses. Higher effort = more thorough reasoning.

**Recommendation:** Start with `"high"` for development work. Switch to `"medium"` or `"low"` for repetitive tasks like bulk file edits or documentation generation.

## Permissions

### defaultMode

Claude Code has four permission modes, each balancing safety against productivity:

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| *(not set)* | Asks permission for every tool use | New users building trust |
| `"dontAsk"` | Allow-listed tools run silently; unlisted tools are silently **denied** | CI pipelines, locked-down environments |
| `"auto"` | Allow-listed tools run silently; unlisted tools go through an **AI classifier** that evaluates safety contextually | Power users who want fewer prompts without losing safety |
| `"bypassPermissions"` | Everything runs without checks | Isolated containers/VMs only -- never on a real machine |

**`"auto"` mode (new in 2.1.83):**

```json
"defaultMode": "auto"
```

The auto mode classifier (runs on Sonnet 4.6) reviews each non-allow-listed action against 26 built-in safety rules (force push, data exfiltration, production deploys, `curl | bash`, etc.). It approves safe actions and blocks risky ones -- no manual prompting needed.

**Key facts about auto mode:**
- Allow-listed commands bypass the classifier entirely (saves tokens and latency)
- Hooks still run regardless of mode -- your `block-git-push.sh` and `protect-config.sh` remain active
- Classifier calls add token cost (small per call, but adds up in long sessions)
- If the classifier blocks an action 3 times consecutively, it falls back to prompting you

**Recommendation:**
- **New users:** Don't set this. Use the default mode until you trust your setup.
- **Power users with hooks:** `"auto"` is the sweet spot -- intelligent safety without prompt fatigue. The allow list becomes a performance optimization, not a security boundary.
- **CI/CD pipelines:** `"dontAsk"` is still better here -- predictable behavior, no classifier overhead.
- **Teams:** See [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md#setting-up-for-teams).

### autoMode.environment

When using `"auto"` mode, you can tell the classifier about your trusted infrastructure:

```json
"autoMode": {
    "environment": [
        "Organization: Your Company. Primary use: web development",
        "Source control: github.com/your-org",
        "Cloud provider(s): AWS (EC2, S3)",
        "Trusted internal domains: *.internal.example.com",
        "Key internal services: PostgreSQL, Redis, CI/CD runners",
        "Platform: macOS / Linux / Windows with Git Bash"
    ]
}
```

**What it does:** Provides context so the classifier can distinguish between "pushing to our GitHub org" (safe) and "pushing to an unknown remote" (blocked).

**Important:** Only set `environment`. Do NOT set `autoMode.allow` or `autoMode.soft_deny` unless you copy ALL defaults first -- setting them **replaces the entire default list**. Run `claude auto-mode defaults` to see the built-in rules.

**Verification:** Run `claude auto-mode config` to see effective rules, or `claude auto-mode critique` for AI feedback on your configuration.

### Team Settings (managed-settings.d/)

For teams deploying organization-wide policies, Claude Code 2.1.83 supports drop-in settings fragments:

```
~/.claude/managed-settings.d/
  01-security-baseline.json
  02-team-conventions.json
```

Files merge alphabetically alongside `managed-settings.json`. Each fragment can enforce policies (deny rules, environment descriptions) independently. Useful when different teams need different rules.

### sandbox.failIfUnavailable

```json
"sandbox": {
    "failIfUnavailable": true
}
```

**What it does:** Exits with an error if sandboxing is enabled but the sandbox runtime can't start, instead of silently falling back to running unsandboxed. Useful in CI/CD where you want to guarantee sandboxed execution.

**Default:** false (falls back to unsandboxed if sandbox unavailable).

### Permission Categories

The `allow` list in the template is organized by category. Here's what each allows:

| Category | What It Allows | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Git Operations** | `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc. | Core development workflow. Note: `git push` is intentionally absent from the allow list. The `block-git-push.sh` hook provides additional domain-level protection. |
| **Package Managers** | `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pip`, `pip3`, `uv`, `composer` | Installing dependencies, running scripts, executing tools. |
| **Runtimes** | `node`, `python`, `python3`, `java` | Running scripts and REPL commands for debugging. |
| **Testing + Linting** | `pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `./node_modules/.bin/*` | Running test suites and linters without permission prompts. |
| **Build + Deploy** | `docker`, `vercel`, `./gradlew` | Building containers, deploying, running Gradle tasks. |
| **CLI Utilities** | `curl`, `ls`, `jq`, `chmod`, `unzip`, `echo`, `sort`, `cut`, `tr`, `tee`, `code` | Common shell utilities for investigation and scripting. |
| **Web Access** | `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `api.github.com`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `WebSearch` | Fetching files from GitHub, checking npm registry, web searches. |
| **MCP Tools** | Playwright browser tools, Context7 docs | Browser automation and documentation lookup. See [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md#mcp-servers--giving-claude-superpowers) for setup. |
| **Skills** | `update-config` | Allows Claude to modify settings via the update-config skill. |

### additionalDirectories

Claude Code can only read/write files in the current working directory by default. This setting grants access to additional paths -- typically your `~/.claude/` directory so Claude can read/edit hooks, agents, skills, and plan files.

**Windows:**
```json
"additionalDirectories": [
  "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\.claude",
  "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\.claude\\skills",
  "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\.claude\\plans",
  "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\.claude\\agents"
]
```

**macOS:**
```json
"additionalDirectories": [
  "/Users/youruser/.claude",
  "/Users/youruser/.claude/skills",
  "/Users/youruser/.claude/plans",
  "/Users/youruser/.claude/agents"
]
```

**Linux:**
```json
"additionalDirectories": [
  "/home/youruser/.claude",
  "/home/youruser/.claude/skills",
  "/home/youruser/.claude/plans",
  "/home/youruser/.claude/agents"
]
```

Replace `YourUser` (Windows) or `youruser` (macOS/Linux) with your actual username.

> **macOS/Linux note:** Tilde expansion (`~/.claude`) is NOT supported in `additionalDirectories` -- use full absolute paths.

## Hooks

The template configures hooks across 8 lifecycle events. For the full lifecycle diagram, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For battle stories explaining why each hook exists, see [WHY.md](WHY.md).

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **SessionStart** | `session-start.sh` | Injects workspace context at the beginning of each session |
| **PreToolUse** (Bash) | `block-git-push.sh` | Blocks `git push` to protected remotes |
| **PreToolUse** (Write/Edit) | `protect-config.sh` | Prevents modifying linter/build configs |
| **PostToolUse** (Write/Edit) | `notify-file-changed.sh` | Reminds Claude to verify after file changes |
| **PostToolUse** (Bash) | `post-commit-review.sh` | Auto-reviews commits for risk flags |
| **PostToolUseFailure** (MCP) | Prompt hook | Guides fallback when MCP tools fail |
| **PreCompact** | `precompact-state.sh` | Serializes working state before context compaction |
| **PostCompact** | Prompt hook | Instructs Claude to restore state from disk |
| **Stop** | Security prompt (Sonnet) + `session-checkpoint.sh` + `cost-tracker.sh` | Security review, state checkpoint, cost logging |
| **SessionEnd** | `session-checkpoint.sh` | Final state save before process exit |

### The Stop Hook's Sonnet Model

The Stop hook uses `"model": "sonnet"` for its security verification prompt. This means every Claude response triggers a Sonnet evaluation for SQL injection, XSS, exposed secrets, and verification gaps. This is the single biggest recurring cost in the blueprint -- but it caught a SQL injection that Haiku missed (see [WHY.md](WHY.md#stop-hook-why-sonnet-not-haiku)).

---

## Cost Implications

**Prices as of March 2026 -- verify at [Anthropic's pricing page](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing) for current rates.**

### Model Pricing Reference

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Used By |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Opus 4.6 | $5 | $25 | project-architect agent |
| Sonnet 4.6 | $3 | $15 | 8 implementation/review agents + Stop hook |
| Haiku 4.5 | $1 | $5 | docs-writer, api-documenter agents |

### What Drives Cost Up

1. **Stop hook (Sonnet on every response):** Each response triggers a Sonnet security review. In a 50-response session, that's 50 additional Sonnet invocations.
2. **Parallel agent spawns:** The review skill spawns up to 3 agents simultaneously. Each agent has its own context window and token budget.
3. **Always-thinking + high effort:** Extended thinking generates additional tokens that are billed. `effortLevel: "high"` increases this further.
4. **Agent teams:** Sessions with active agent teams use roughly 7x more tokens than standard sessions (per Anthropic's official docs).
5. **Playwright MCP vs CLI:** The Playwright MCP server streams full DOM accessibility trees into context (~114K tokens per task). Running `npx playwright test` via Bash uses ~27K tokens for the same work -- a 76% reduction. Use MCP for interactive browser exploration; use CLI for test execution.

### Rough Daily Estimates

From [Anthropic's official Claude Code cost documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs):

| Usage Pattern | Daily Cost (approx) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Light (5-10 responses) | ~$1-3 |
| Average developer | ~$6/day |
| Heavy (100+ responses, agents) | ~$12+ |
| 90th percentile | below $12/day |

### How to Track Your Actual Costs

The blueprint includes [cost-tracker.sh](hooks/cost-tracker.sh) as a Stop hook that logs session costs to a JSONL file. Check your metrics at `~/.claude/metrics/costs.jsonl` for actual spending data.

### How to Reduce Costs

- **Disable always-thinking** for simple tasks: set `"alwaysThinkingEnabled": false` or use `/fast` mode
- **Lower effort level** to `"medium"` for routine work
- **Use Haiku for documentation agents** (already configured in this blueprint)
- **Remove the Stop hook** if you trust your code review process (not recommended, but it's the biggest cost lever)
- **Limit parallel agents** by modifying skills to spawn fewer reviewers
