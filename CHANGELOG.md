## [Unreleased]

## 2026-04-04

### Added
- **FAQ.md**: New file answering top 9 community questions -- framework agnosticism, skill levels, subscription plans, tool compatibility, colleague quickstart, "I'm overwhelmed" guidance, AI-vs-learning, cost/tokens
- **README.md**: "Who Is This For?" persona table moved above the fold (from line 173 to ~line 47) with new "Time to Value" column and Level 1/2/3 skill progression
- **README.md**: Mini-FAQ section (4 one-line answers linking to FAQ.md)
- **README.md**: Deep Dives grid expanded from 2x3 to 3x3 (added FAQ, Getting Started, Troubleshooting)
- **GETTING-STARTED.md**: "Got This Link from a Colleague?" quickstart flow in beginner section
- **GETTING-STARTED.md**: FAQ.md link at end of beginner section and in "What to Learn Next" list

### Changed

- **README.md**: "What Makes This Different" table gains framework-agnostic row
- **README.md**: Standalone Troubleshooting section absorbed into Deep Dives grid
- **README.ja.md, README.ko.md, README.zh.md**: All structural changes mirrored with translations
- **README.zh.md**: Hero subtitle rewritten to remove "advanced users" framing (was "为 Claude Code 高级用户设计")
- GitHub repo description updated: removed "power users", added "framework-agnostic" and "beginner-friendly"
- GitHub topics: added `beginner-friendly`, `framework-agnostic`

## 2026-04-03

### Added
- **CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md**: Cursor coverage expansion -- hooks.json example, `permissions.json`, `.cursorignore`, CLI/IDE hook disparity, "Cursor in depth" section
- **hooks/README.md + ARCHITECTURE.md**: `PermissionDenied` and `TaskCreated` hook events (available but not used in blueprint)
- **SETTINGS-GUIDE.md**: `disableSkillShellExecution` setting, `showThinkingSummaries` setting (default off since v2.1.89), `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` env var, `PermissionDenied` hook note under auto mode
- **GETTING-STARTED.md**: `/powerup` interactive tutorial mention for beginners
- **agents/README.md**: Named subagent pattern (`name` parameter for `@` mention and `SendMessage` addressability)

### Changed
- Version badge updated from 2.1.85 to 2.1.91
- Cursor hooks reframed from "partial subset" to "different surfaces" (11 hook types listed by name)
- Removed unconfirmed `.cursor/agents/*.md` claims from CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md (feature not shipped)

### Fixed
- Added `permissions.json` alongside `cli-config.json` at all Cursor references in CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md

## 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Hook safety**: Python fallback in `block-git-push.sh`, JSON injection in `post-commit-review.sh`/`precompact-state.sh`/`cost-tracker.sh`, shell injection in `session-start.sh`/`verify-mcp-sync.sh`, error handling in `session-checkpoint.sh`
- **Factual accuracy**: Permission modes table was missing `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer` (across 4 files), `CONTRIBUTING.md` had wrong model IDs and non-existent "Notification" event, lifecycle event count was 12 (should be 10), `git push` allow-list claim was wrong
- **Playwright MCP**: Package name corrected from `@anthropic-ai/mcp-playwright` to `@playwright/mcp`
- **Agent inconsistencies**: Removed `Bash` from `db-analyst`/`devops-engineer` tools (contradicts `permissionMode: plan`), removed `skills: [review]` from `security-reviewer` (recursion risk)
- **Cost tracker**: Added 10MB size cap to prevent unbounded JSONL growth
- **Python version**: Hooks now require Python 3.6+ (f-strings used), was incorrectly claiming 2.7+

### Added
- **Agent hardening**: "When project context is missing" graceful degradation in all 11 agents
- **agents/README.md**: maxTurns table, cost estimates, hallucination warnings, instruction compliance explanation
- **Configuration placement**: "Where Config Belongs" section in GETTING-STARTED.md with project-vs-personal table and cross-platform paths for 7 AI tools
- **Safer setup prompt**: Explicitly directs to `~/.claude/`, not project directory
- **Placeholder variables**: All 6 documented in skills/README.md with grep check command
- **Privacy notice**: Bold warning + `.gitignore` template + "What NOT to Store" in memory-template/README.md
- **Troubleshooting**: 7 new sections (MEMORYCORE_PATH, agent permissions, maxTurns, config placement, Windows hooks, shell compatibility, git history)
- **Safety callouts**: "Before You Start" in README.md + all 3 localized READMEs (ja/ko/zh), secrets warning in CLAUDE.md
- `.gitattributes` enforcing LF line endings for `.sh` files
- `hooks/test-hooks.sh` smoke test script (35 tests: syntax, Python detection, empty/malformed/missing-field input)

### Changed
- Version badge updated from 2.1.83 to 2.1.85
- All hooks now use unified Python detection with "not found" stderr warning
- All hooks construct JSON via Python `json.dumps()` (no shell string interpolation)
- Pricing URLs standardized to `docs.anthropic.com`
- Removed version-pinned feature attributions ("new in 2.1.83")
