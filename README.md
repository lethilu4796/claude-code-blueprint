# Claude Code Blueprint

A battle-tested reference architecture for Claude Code power users. Not a plugin to install — a blueprint to learn from and adapt.

> Last verified with **Claude Code 2.1.83** (March 2026). Core patterns work across versions; version-specific features are noted inline.

**Available in:** [English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md) | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

## What This Is

This repository documents a production Claude Code setup built over numerous sessions of real development work. Every agent, skill, hook, and rule exists because a real incident taught us it was needed.

**This is NOT a generic starter kit.** It's a reference architecture showing how a power user configures Claude Code for maximum productivity, with the reasoning behind every decision.

**New to Claude Code?** Start with [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md) — a beginner-friendly walkthrough covering the CLI, MCP servers, plugins, and your first 30 minutes.

## What's Inside

| Component | Count | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| [**Agents**](agents/) | 11 | Specialized subagents with model tiering (opus/sonnet/haiku) |
| [**Skills**](skills/) | 17 | Natural-language-triggered workflows (no slash commands needed) |
| [**Hooks**](hooks/) | 10 | Deterministic lifecycle automation (10 hook events) |
| [**Rules**](rules/) | 5 | Path-scoped behavioral constraints |
| [**Memory System**](memory-template/) | Dual | Auto-memory + external git-backed persistence |
| [**CLAUDE.md**](CLAUDE.md) | Template | Battle-tested behavioral rules |
| [**Settings**](examples/settings-template.json) | Template | Full hook + permission configuration |

## Philosophy

1. **Hooks for enforcement, CLAUDE.md for guidance** — Hooks fire 100% of the time. CLAUDE.md instructions are followed ~80%. If something MUST happen, make it a hook.

2. **Agent-scoped knowledge, not global bloat** — Design principles live in the frontend agent, not in every session's context. Security patterns live in the security-reviewer, not in CLAUDE.md.

3. **Context is currency** — Every token loaded into context is a token not available for your code. Keep MEMORY.md under 100 lines. Extract to topic files. Use path-scoped rules so irrelevant rules don't load.

4. **Battle-tested over theoretical** — Every rule in this repo exists because something went wrong without it. The "WHY" matters more than the "WHAT".

## Getting Started

### Option A: Fork (recommended)
Fork this repo to customize it as your own living reference. You can pull upstream updates later as the blueprint evolves.

### Option B: Clone + Copy
Clone the repo, then selectively copy components into your `~/.claude/` directory.

### Option C: Cherry-pick
Browse the repo on GitHub and copy only the specific files you need. No installation required.

### Recommended adoption path

1. **Start with [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — the behavioral rules template. Biggest impact with zero setup.
2. **Add 2-3 hooks** — [`protect-config.sh`](hooks/protect-config.sh) + [`notify-file-changed.sh`](hooks/notify-file-changed.sh) + [`cost-tracker.sh`](hooks/cost-tracker.sh). Copy to `~/.claude/hooks/` and wire into [`settings.json`](examples/settings-template.json).
3. **Read [WHY.md](WHY.md)** to understand the reasoning — adapt, don't blindly copy.
4. **Add agents** as your workflow matures — start with `verify-plan` and `code-reviewer`.
5. **Set up the [memory system](memory-template/)** when you need cross-session persistence.

### Who is this for?

| You Are | Start Here | Adopt |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Solo dev, small project** | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) + 2 hooks | Enough. Don't over-engineer. |
| **Small startup (2-5 devs)** | Above + shared rules + 2-3 agents | See [Team Setup](GETTING-STARTED.md#setting-up-for-teams) |
| **Established team (5+ devs)** | Full blueprint, adapted | Fork, customize, commit shared config |
| **Learning to code** | [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md) only | Ignore agents/skills/memory until comfortable |
| **Coming from another tool** | [CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md](CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md) | Concepts transfer; adapt what you need |

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system design, component relationships, and hook lifecycle diagram.

## Settings

See [SETTINGS-GUIDE.md](SETTINGS-GUIDE.md) for a complete explanation of every environment variable, permission, and hook in [settings-template.json](examples/settings-template.json) -- including cost implications and the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` flag required for multi-agent workflows.

## Battle Stories

See [WHY.md](WHY.md) for the incidents and lessons behind every component. This is the most valuable file in the repo — it explains *why* each piece exists.

## Using with Other AI Coding Tools

While this blueprint is built for Claude Code, the **concepts are universal**. See [CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md](CROSS-TOOL-GUIDE.md) for a mapping of how each concept translates to Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Windsurf.

## Starter Presets

Not sure where to start? **[PRESETS.md](PRESETS.md)** has ready-to-copy file lists for solo devs, teams, and CI/CD pipelines -- with exact settings.json snippets for each tier.

## Benchmarks

Real-world performance data. **[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)** shows token savings, cost impact, and quality metrics from production use.

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to common issues -- hooks not firing, agents failing, MCP crashes, cost surprises, and Windows-specific problems.

## Plugin Compatibility

This blueprint is designed as a **standalone configuration** — no plugins required. In fact, plugins can interfere with a custom setup:

### Known issues
- **Plugins that modify CLAUDE.md** may overwrite your custom behavioral rules
- **Plugins that add hooks** on the same events (e.g., Stop, PreToolUse) will stack with your hooks — this can cause slowdowns or conflicting instructions
- **Plugins that inject context** consume tokens from your context window, leaving less room for your agents and memory system
- **MCP server plugins** work well alongside this setup — they add tools, not rules, so there's no conflict

### Recommendation
If you adopt this blueprint, audit your installed plugins and disable any that:
1. Override CLAUDE.md or settings.json hooks
2. Inject prompts on SessionStart (conflicts with your session-lifecycle rule)
3. Add broad permissions that bypass your permission restrictions

Custom setup > generic plugins, because your setup encodes YOUR project's domain knowledge. A plugin can't know your architecture, your team's conventions, or your production constraints.

## Acknowledgments

The memory system pattern in this blueprint was inspired by [Project-AI-MemoryCore](https://github.com/Kiyoraka/Project-AI-MemoryCore) by Kiyoraka — a comprehensive AI memory architecture with 11 feature extensions (LRU project management, memory consolidation, echo recall, and more). If you want a deeper, more feature-rich memory system than the minimal scaffold included here, check out that project.

**How they differ:** This blueprint covers the *full Claude Code configuration* (agents, skills, hooks, rules, settings). The `memory-template/` here is a lightweight scaffold. Project-AI-MemoryCore goes deep on the memory layer specifically — they're complementary, not competing.
